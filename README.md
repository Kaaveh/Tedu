### ‚§µÔ∏è Download
Tedu is currently released on Google Play, but it's released under an alpha program that is not available to public users. If you want to join the alpha program and test the app in its early stages, please drop an email at [phelatco@gmail.com](mailto:phelatco@gmail.com), and I will send you an invitation.
### ü§ù Contribute
I'm pretty sure that everyone can contribute to this project, even without the knowledge in computer science and programming. So please, if you have free time, consider contributing to this project in these areas:
- **Report a bug**. If you've ever encountered a bug in the app, please consider reporting it through this [link](https://github.com/PHELAT/Tedu/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=). If you think this is too complicated, it's totally fine, and you can report the bug in plain English to me through this [phelatco@gmail.com](mailto:phelatco@gmail.com) email address.
- **Propose a feature**. If you think a feature is missing from the app, please consider proposing it through this [link](https://github.com/PHELAT/Tedu/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=). If you think this is too complicated, it's totally fine, and you can propose the feature in plain English to me through this [phelatco@gmail.com](mailto:phelatco@gmail.com) email address.
- **Translate**. If you are familiar with a language other than English, you can help to translate the app to that language, and it's pretty straight forward, you don't need to be a computer expert or anything, I'm just going to send you a list of words and sentences that we've used in the app, and you'll send us their translation. It's that simple, and to get started, send me an email([phelatco@gmail.com](mailto:phelatco@gmail.com)) so that I could send you the list of words and sentences.
- **Pull request**. If you are a software engineer and understand Kotlin, you can help and contribute to this project by working on the reported bugs, refactor the code and keep it fresh, or even implement a new feature that you think it's cool to have(But before that, make sure to contact me and describe what you want to achieve).  

**There is going to be a page inside the app with a list of all contributors and a link to their social media(Of course, with their permission).**
